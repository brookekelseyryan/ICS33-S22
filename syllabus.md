### Catalogue description

‚ÄúIntermediate-level language features and programming concepts for larger, more complex, higher-quality software. Functional programming, name spaces, modules, class protocols, inheritance, iterators, generators, operator overloading, reflection. Analysis of time and space efficiency.‚Äù

### Introduction

Welcome to ICS33: Intermediate Programming. You are in this course probably because you want to pursue a Computer Science major, or you are interested in learning more about programming. In this course, I will walk you through the fundamentals of the Python programming languages and basics of important computer science concepts. The goal of this course is to get you started with the tools you will need for building high-quality, large-scale, and complex programs in the future.

### Prerequisites

1. Familiarity with Python
2. Familiarity with basic programming concepts: functions, data types, logic flows

### Student Learning Outcomes

After successful completion of this course, students should be able to:

1. Get familiar with the syntax, data types, and basic libraries in Python.
2. Get familiar with important programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, functional programming, etc.
3. Understand basic computer science concepts such as data structures and algorithm analysis.
4. Write programs that fulfill basic application.

### Books

There will be no required textbook for this class, as there are many great online resources. You can search for and get answers for all the topics we discuss in this class. The following books are recommended for reading and further studying:

1. Learning Python, Mark Lutz, O‚ÄôReilly
2. Fluent Python, Luciano Rmaiho
 
### How to Succeed

1. Attend lectures and actively participate.
2. Work on the labs and homework yourself.
3. Ask questions, during lectures, office hours, and on Canvas or by email.
4. Form study groups

### Canvas

Canvas will be the main information source for the course, so please check it daily.

### Assignments

The assignments for this course have three major components:

### Labs

There will be weekly labs, except for the midterm and final week. There will be 8 labs in total. You will receive full credits if you submit a file for each lab. However, I highly encourage you to work on each lab and complete it as much as you can.

### Lab Attendance 

In-person lab sessions occur Tuesdays and Thursdays 1:00-2:50pm in ICS 183. This time slot ensures that our classroom has access to computers with the required environments and software to complete your labs and assignments on. You can use this time to get help from instructors, since office hours occur in this time and place. Attendance during this time block is not required, you may find additional lab hours posted here: https://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/lab_schedule/index.php.

You may choose to work remotely instead of in ICS 183, however, you will need to ensure that your machine is set up with the same environment as found in the labs. At the very least, if you program your assignment/labs remotely, we strongly recommend that you test your program on the lab computers to ensure that it runs smoothly in this environment. This is the same environment used to grade the assignments. It is your responsibility to ensure that your assignments work on the lab computers. Because of limited instructor resources, and to ensure that priority goes towards answering questions relevant to all students in the course, we cannot answer questions related to your home machine setup (instead, we recommend you work on the computers in the lab). 

Since this course is fast-paced and contains challenging material, we recommend that you come to the labs early and often to ensure that you get the help you need to succeed. It is also a great space to meet regularly with your study group.

### Programming assignments

There will be 3 programming assignments, all of which should be completed individually. However, you are free to discuss with your peers, but no codes can be duplicated from your peers. The programming assignments will be graded based on rubrics. Even if your program does not provide the final desired output, if you complete some functions and requirements, partial credits will be assigned. Therefore, I highly recommend that you complete the programming assignment as much as you can.

### Project

More details about the project will be posted.

### Exams

There will be two exams, both of which will be open notes.

### Communication

#### Email

To help us quickly identify course-related emails and respond to you, please try using the format: ICS33: First Name Last Name ‚Äì Subject. Please ensure to include both the instructor (lu.he@uci.edu) and the TA (brooke.ryan@uci.edu) in the email.

#### Office hour

Office hour is the best time for one-on-one communication to either go through your programs together or resolve other course-related issues. If you cannot make the office hour but still want to meet in person, please schedule at least 2 days ahead of time.

#### Discord

Forming a study group can help reinforce your learning and keep yourself accountable, as the course content moves quickly. While not required, we strongly recommend you get to know your classmates and form a study group. To help facilitate this process, we have created a class Discord channel: https://discord.gg/qxjajH2v.

Please note, that while the instructor team will monitor the Discord from time to time to ensure it is not being abused, we will not be using it as the official question forum. Please use Piazza for getting instructor responses to questions. 

You may also use the Discord to share useful resources or ideas for solving problems. Posting lab solutions, homework solutions, or code snippets on the Discord channel is a violation of academic integrity and violators will be referred to the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct. Inappropriate content, harassment, or abusive language of any kind will not be tolerated on the channel.  

#### Piazza

Join the course space on Piazza. Piazza is for posting questions related to labs, programming assignments, and exams. You are encouraged to post questions or resources that you think other students will also benefit from. Similarly, do not post labs or homework solutions and code snippets. 

### Academic Dishonesty

All students are expected to adhere to the UCI Academic Dishonesty Policies (for more information, please visit https://aisc.uci.edu/students/academic-integrity/index.php . 

### Regrades

#### Time limits for requesting a regrade

Regrade requests will not be accepted after 48 hours of the grade release. A regrade request should be sent to the TA within 48 hours of grade release with the following content to be considered for regrading: parts of the submission that you think should be regraded and reasons for requesting a regrade. The more specific and clear your regrade request is the better.

### Disability Services

The University of California, Irvine, is committed to providing a barrier-free environment for learning and an electronic environment that is accessible to everyone, including individuals with disabilities. If you have a disability and feel you need accommodations in this program or a course, please contact the Disability Services Center. (DSC). DSC approved accommodations will be provided for students who present a Faculty Notification Letter from the DSC. Note that services are confidential, may take time to put into place, and are not retroactive. Captions and alternate media for print materials may take three or more weeks to get produced. Please contact the DSC as possible if accommodations are needed.
